Daniel Libatique and Ryan Pasco, graduate students in Boston University's [Department of Classical Studies at Boston University](http://www.bu.edu/classics/), have long been interested in digital tools for Classics, but what tools were available or how they could be applied in a classroom setting. Keeping the beginner in mind, Daniel and Ryan created *ergaleia*, an abbreviated list of digital tools for the classicist that emphasizes utility and application rather than functionality while representing a broad range of functionalities. They hope that this list, along with the accompanying blog, will help those interested in digital tools gain a sense of what's available and how to apply this knowledge to teaching and research. For recent updates, follow *ergaleia* on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/ta_ergaleia).
